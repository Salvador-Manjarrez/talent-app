            <x-page-heading-2> The Raindance Organisation </x-page-heading-2>
            <p>         
                The organisation was founded in 1992 by Elliot Grove as a thought experiment: can you make a film with no money, no training and no experience? The first Raindance event was a masterclass with Dov Simens held in London in April 1992.
                Raindance is dedicated to fostering and promoting independent film around the world. Based in the heart of London, Raindance combines Raindance Film Festival, training courses — which are offered throughout the year at our 10 international hubs — and the British Independent Film Awards.

                In October 1993, the Raindance Film Festival was born, held at London’s Prince Charles Cinema and Ciné Lumière. The festival runs annually in September in London’s West End.
                In 1998, Raindance created the British Independent Film Awards, an annual celebration of the best UK independent films of the year held in December. Top honours have been awarded to My Name is Joe, Billy Elliot, Vera Drake, This Is England, Slumdog Millionaire, Pride and American Honey.
